**Adaptation**
This code was adapted to work for Argumentation Mining and Debate Stance
Prediction tasks to serve as baselines for my own research on deep
relational learning for NLP. The relational objectives where connected
to powerful language encoders and features relevant to the tasks at hand
(BiLSTMs, BERT, etc.)

**Introduction**

This is the PyTorch implementation of the [RotatE](https://openreview.net/forum?id=HkgEQnRqYQ) model for knowledge graph embedding (KGE). We provide a toolkit that gives state-of-the-art performance of several popular KGE models. The toolkit is quite efficient, which is able to train a large KGE model within a few hours on a single GPU.

A faster multi-GPU implementation of RotatE and other KGE models is available in [GraphVite](https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/graphvite).
